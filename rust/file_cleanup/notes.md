# Notes:

### Matching and Filtering
Consider how this should be done.

If I use Include and Exclude then it makes the user's life harder.
If I skip them, then I still need a clear way for the user to specify what they want to do. 

I like the idea of using file types, extensions, string matching, and regex.


Also need to make sure that the one higher up in the configuration gets handled first.
