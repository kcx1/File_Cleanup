# Create Entries for directories that you would like cleaned.

# The names of these can be anything that you like, the only one that has to match
# is "Logs", as this one is used to create the log file that gets generated from the
# script

#[Example]
#
#    path = "some/path/"                    If not absolute, it is assumed to be relative to the user's /home
#    operation = "move | delete"            Mode of cleanup; can move files or delete them.

#    OPTIONAL
#    time.number = int                      number is an integear multiplied by the unit; default is 30 d
#    time.unit = "M | H | D"                Unit of time is defined in Minutes, Hours, Days. Whole words or abbreviations can be used.
#
#
#    [[Example.move]]                       If you set the mode to move; you need to specify a few additional filter parameters
#    name = "name"                          Currently not used programatically, but helpful to keep things organized. Not required.
#    type = [".pdf", '.jpg', '.doc']        A list of the file extensions you want to include in this filter. ".*" to select all.
#    destination = "some/path"

#    OPTIONAL
#    filter.name = "Name"                   Named for organization only; not used.
#    filter.destination = "some/path/"
#    filter.time.number = int               Define a time if you want a different time for your filter. Needs to be less time than the parent time.
#    filter.time.unit = "M | H | D"
#    filter.list = ["Extra", "filters"]     All of these get included in the filter.
#                                           The additional filter help you have different parameters for files with the same extension. For EXAMPLE:
#                                           You can have screenshots go to a different folder than all of the other .png files.

#[Logs] #EXAMPLE
#    enable = true | false                  Enable / disable logs
#    path = "Documents/Files/Logs/"         Path to logs - not including log file name.
#    name = "cleanup.log"                   Log file name
#    max_size = 100                         KiloBytes - If not provided default of 100 is used.
